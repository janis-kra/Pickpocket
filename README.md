#Pickpocket

##Introduction

I hate the fact that my Pocket list grows larger and larger as I keep adding articles (manually as well as automatically via services such as ifttt). Pickpocket aims to automatically remove unread items matching specific (configurable) criteria from the user's list in order to retain a slim list. Such criteria are:

 * lifespan (how old must an article be in order to be deleted)
 * source (black-/whitelist certain URLs)
 * tag (black-/whitelist certain tags) 
 * favored / not favored

I will probably add other options while the development of Pickpocket advances.  

Pickpocket will run on node.js.
